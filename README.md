# Consistent-formation-control-algorithm
Consistent formation control algorithm in ROS2!

The node graph is like:

![a node graph](./image/rosgraph.png)

## What it can do?

~~Do a lot...~~

Such as formation control, by publishing topic MC/set_offsets...

You can test your control algorithm, while I just use position control...

It may work, I hope so...

## Test video

In test_video, github do not support open video in markdown...

## How to use it

It's based ros2 and control toolbox. You need them first.

Install ROS2 and Control Toolbox.(You may find them in github...)

Install gazebo.

Copy "model/**my_model**" to the model path of gazebo.

Then build by command "**colcon build**".

**That's all building step.**

Next, run command "**gazebo world/three_aircraft_formation.world**"

Then run command "**ros2 run robot_key_control tac**"

You may see something great.

## Update log

03.01: Add ct in code. It's 23:36 and I think it's too late to work. Still I do some work... Update REDEME

03.02: Clean code and so on...

Add limit of line speed... **It's more stable now!**

Fix dividing zero bug...

Add topic "MC/set_offsets" for formation setting, you can publish the topic to change formation...

Add two new video...

## TODO:

1. ~~Add a subscription to change every robot's offset~~, choose the leader robot and so on.
2. ~~Add limit...ï¼ˆIt's import!)~~
3. Add a controller like PID or MPC.(Now it's position control...)
4. ~~Fix bug...~~ **Now no bug found!**
5. ~~Make source away from hpp...~~(It's not import but easy...)
6. ~~Get some Wend-Oil~~, **I wanna sleep!!!** ~~And I'm gonna sleep!!!~~ Got a lot of wend-oil now...
7. Test algorithm in real system...(Hope no error...)
8. Clean code! It's too redundancy!!!!!
