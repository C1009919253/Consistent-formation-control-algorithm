## How to use it

It's based ros2 and control toolbox. You need them first.

Install ROS2 and Control Toolbox.(You may find them in github...)

Install gazebo.

Copy "model/**my_model**" to the model path of gazebo.

Then build by command "**colcon build**".

**That's all building step.**

Next, run command "**gazebo world/three_aircraft_formation.world**"

Then run command "**ros2 run robot_key_control tac**"

You may see something great.
